ECOSYSTEM CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
From: TrustHome (DarkWave Studios LLC)
To: TrustVault / DW Media Studio
Date: February 9, 2026
Re: Tenant API Connectivity for Video Walkthrough & Media Editing Integration

OVERVIEW

TrustHome has built and deployed a tenant space for DW Media Studio within the DarkWave ecosystem. Our platform is ready to connect. We need TrustVault to expose the following API contract so TrustHome agents can request video walkthroughs, track media projects, and receive completed assets directly inside their dashboard.

1. AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL

All requests between our apps use the standard DarkWave HMAC signature scheme:

Header: Authorization: DW <apiKey>:<timestamp>:<signature>
Signature: HMAC-SHA256 of <timestamp>:<apiKey> using the shared API secret
Header: X-App-Name: TrustHome
We need you to generate and provide us an API key pair (DW_MEDIA_API_KEY and DW_MEDIA_API_SECRET) scoped to the TrustHome tenant
2. TENANT SCOPING

Every request from TrustHome includes a tenantId value of "trusthome":

On GET requests: passed as query parameter ?tenantId=trusthome
On POST/PUT requests: included in the JSON body as { "tenantId": "trusthome", ... }
All projects, assets, and jobs must be scoped to this tenant to keep ecosystem apps isolated.

3. ENDPOINTS WE NEED EXPOSED

Base URL we are configured to call: https://media.darkwavestudios.io/api

Method	Endpoint	Request	Expected Response
GET	/status	?tenantId=trusthome	{ configured: bool, capabilities: string[], version: string }
GET	/projects	?tenantId=trusthome	{ projects: [{ id, title, status, propertyAddress, createdAt, thumbnailUrl }] }
GET	/projects/:id	?tenantId=trusthome	Full project detail: timeline, assets, render status, outputUrl
GET	/projects/:id/status	?tenantId=trusthome	`{ status: "queued"
POST	/walkthrough-request	{ tenantId, propertyAddress, propertyId?, requestType, notes?, agentId }	{ requestId, status: "queued", estimatedTurnaround }
POST	/projects/:id/cancel	{ tenantId }	{ success: bool, message }
4. CAPABILITIES WE EXPECT

Please confirm which of the following your API supports:

video_walkthrough - property walkthrough video creation from raw footage
video_editing - cuts, transitions, effects, color grading
audio_editing - voiceover overlay, background music, audio mixing
media_combining - merge multiple clips into single output
branded_intros - agent/brokerage branded intro and outro sequences
voiceover - AI-generated or recorded voiceover integration
multi_angle_stitch - combine footage from multiple camera angles
thumbnail_generation - auto-generate listing thumbnails from video
5. WEBHOOK CALLBACK

When a job completes or fails, POST back to us:

URL: https://<trusthome-domain>/api/media-studio/webhook
Method: POST
Auth: Same HMAC signature scheme (sign with your key pair)
Payload: { requestId, status, outputUrl, thumbnailUrl, duration, tenantId, completedAt }
6. REAL-TIME UPDATES (OPTIONAL)

We have a dedicated #Media Studio channel in our ecosystem-wide Signal Chat. If you want to push real-time status updates:

Socket.IO relay: wss://darkwavestudios.io
Channel ID: ecosystem-media
Source app identifier: mediastudio
7. WHAT WE NEED BACK

To go live, provide us:

API key pair (DW_MEDIA_API_KEY / DW_MEDIA_API_SECRET)
Confirmed base URL (we default to https://media.darkwavestudios.io/api)
List of supported capabilities from Section 4
Confirmation of webhook callback format from Section 5
Once we receive the key pair, the connection goes live immediately - no rebuild required on our side. Everything is already wired.
